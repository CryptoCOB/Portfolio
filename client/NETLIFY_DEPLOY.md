## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version (requires v18+)
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for console errors in build log

### Routes Not Working (404)
- Verify `_redirects` file is in `public` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` has correct redirects configuration

### Styles Not Loading
- Clear browser cache
- Check build output includes CSS files
- Verify Tailwind CSS is configured correctly

## 🎯 Environment Variables (If Needed)

If you add any API keys or secrets later:

1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add variables (never commit secrets to Git!)
3. Redeploy site
