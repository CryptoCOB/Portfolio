> Assignment1)]{.underline}**

1.  Configure the Backend of your portfolio Application, you already
    have the frontend in Assignment1 -- **(15 marks)**

Steps:

a.  Using the power point slide and the final zip file provided from
    week3 -- Configuring the backend and frontend of your application or
    week6 final zip folder in your course shell, make a copy of the
    folder (Ensure to still keep a copy for the purpose of our class use
    case) rename the folder you copied from mern_skeleton as
    MyPortfolio.

b.  From Assignment 1 folder copy the client folder and replace it with
    the client folder in the new MyPortfolio folder in Assignment2.

> [NOTE1:]{.underline} You will have to delete the client folder in the
> MyPortfolio folder before pasting to avoid duplication.
>
> [NOTE2:]{.underline} At the terminal change the directory to client
> folder run the application by running the command **yarn dev or npm
> run dev.**
>
> You will notice only the Frontend is running on port 5173.
> <http://localhost:5173/>

>
> Open a new terminal, at the root run the command node server.js
>
> You will notice the Backend running on port 5000 or 3000 or the port
> number you have used.

c.  Stop the server from running and also stop the frontend from
    running.

d.  To ensure the frontend and Backend run concurrently open a new
    terminal.

e.  At the terminal change the directory to client folder and install
    nodemon and concurrently to be able to run it concurrently at the
    same time.

> yarn add \--dev nodemon.

f.  Open the package.json in the client in the scripts section update
    the "dev":"vite" with Â \"dev\": \"concurrently \'vite\' \\nodemon
    ../server.js\\\",

g.  Open a new terminal, cd client, then run **yarn dev**

    b.  Create the following collections with their respective property.
        (5 Marks: Functionality).

<!-- -->

I.  **contacts**

> firstname: string
>
> lastname: string
>
> email: string

II. **projects**

> title: string
>
> firstname: string
>
> lastname: string
>
> email: string

IV. **users**

> name: string
>
> email: string
>
> password: string
>

>
> updated: Date

a.  Obtain your connection string ( url or uri)

b.  Provide the screen snapshot of your MongoDB database showing the
    above steps from 1a -- c.

<!-- -->

3.  Configure the Backend of your portfolio Application by creating the
    server.js file in the root folder for your server and a server
    folder or backend folder in the root folder for all your backend
    code.

    a.  Update the server.js file i.e the server with code to display
        the message shown in the snapshot below when you run the app and
        provide a screen snapshot of it running in the browser as
        follows:

4.  Create the web server after creating the Express web server next:
    **(30 Marks)**

    a.  Add the configuration for the MongoDB database, ensure your
        application is connected to the database and give the screen
        snapshot of the connection from your console.
